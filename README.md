# ProjectEulerObjectiveC
Some objective c solutions to project euler questions


I seperated out each solution into its own class to make it easy.  
Sometimes I made the solutions capable of solving for different values than just the project Euler.
Look at main.m for the calling of the methods and the corresponding nslogs.
